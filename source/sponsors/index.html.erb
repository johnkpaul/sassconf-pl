    <p>OddBird is a small team that thrives on freely shared ideas &amp; playful
      collaboration, crossing disciplines, breaking boundaries, and eating our
      dessert with the soup spoon. From working on open-source tools like
      Django, Compass, and Susy to building web applications for Mozilla,
      The K Network, Providence Plan, Junyo, or ORCAS&mdash;and our own experiments
      in digital storytelling&mdash;we love molding ideas into experiences that
      people can use.</p>
